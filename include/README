This directory is intended for storing project header files.

A **header file** contains C declarations and macro definitions that can be shared across multiple source files in the project. To use a header file in a C or C++ source file (typically located in the `src` folder), include it using the preprocessor directive `#include`:

```c
// src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main(void)
{
    ...
}
```

Including a header file has the same effect as copying its contents into each source file that needs it. However, using header files is cleaner and more maintainable:

* Declarations exist in a single location.
* Changes only need to be made once.
* All source files that include the header will automatically use the updated version after recompilation.

This helps reduce duplication, prevents inconsistencies, and simplifies project maintenance.

In C, itâ€™s standard to name header files with a `.h` extension. For maximum portability, use only letters, digits, dashes, and underscores in header file names, and limit to a single dot.
